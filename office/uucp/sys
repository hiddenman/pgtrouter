# This is an example of a sys file. This file have the syntax compatible

# This is an example of a sys file, the file(s) which describe remote
# systems for Taylor UUCP.  To use it, you must compile the package
# with HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG set to 1 in policy.h (that is the default),
# copy this file to newconfigdir as set in Makefile.in (the default is
# /usr/local/conf/uucp), and edit it as appropriate for your system.

# If you do not use the ``unknown'' command in the config file, then
# each system that you communicate with must be listed in a sys file.

# Everything after a '#' character is a comment.  To uncomment any of
# the sample lines below, just delete the '#'.

# This is a sample sys file that might be used in a leaf system.  A
# leaf system is one that only contacts one other system.  sys2
# provides another example.
